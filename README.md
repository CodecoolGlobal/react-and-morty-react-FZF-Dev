Do you know Rick and Morty? If not, start watching, it's a hilarious show!

Anyways, the Rick and Morty universe is kinda big with lot of characters and locations. As fans, we decided that it is our duty to make an encyclopedia about characters and locations in the Rick and Morty universe.

The üí° **tech** üõ†Ô∏è we have used in the project:

* React (JSX)
* Javascript
* HTML5
* CSS3
* VS Code
* Node.js
* Git

Sounds fun right? Let's fire up this bad boy! Here is what you have to do:

üëâ Prerequisites:

* Git
* npm
* Node.js
* VS Code (optional)

need to be installed on your system.

First of all you need to clone the repository onto your computer. After that is done, make sure to change directory to the root directory of the local repository. There, you need to issue this command:

### npm i

This will install all the dependencies which our app needs to run. When npm has done its thiing, issue the next command:

### npm start

This is basically the switch which will run our app, open a browser, or a new tab in an already open browser on your machine and if everything went according to plan, you should see the landing page of said web app:

At this point, you are free to navigate. The app has two categories:

1. Locations üìç
2. Characters üôé

Under each category, you can find detailed information of each object in the given category. For example the name and species of characters as well as type and dimension of all locations. Pop up windows on click and infinite scroll will aid navigation throughout the app. The app is still under development.

Quick question: Are you using internet explorer? There is an easter egg on the landing page. Can you find it? üí¨
