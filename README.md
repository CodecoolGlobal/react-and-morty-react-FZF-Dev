Do you know Rick and Morty? If not, start watching, it's a hilarious show!

Anyways, the Rick and Morty universe is kinda big with lot of characters and locations. As fans, we decided that it is our duty to make an encyclopedia about characters and locations in the Rick and Morty universe.

The üí° **tech** üõ†Ô∏è we have used in the project:

* React (JSX)
* Javascript
* HTML5
* CSS3
* VS Code
* Node.js
* Git

Sounds fun right? Let's fire up this bad boy! Here is what you have to do:

üëâ Prerequisites:

* Git
* npm
* Node.js
* VS Code (optional)

need to be installed on your system.

First of all you need to clone the repository onto your computer. After that is done, make sure to change directory to the root directory of the local repository. There, you need to issue this command:

## npm i

This will install all the dependencies which our app needs to run. When npm has done its thiing, issue the next command:

## npm start

This is basically the switch which will run our app, open a browser, or a new tab in an already open browser on your machine and if everything went according to plan, you should see the landing page of said web app:
